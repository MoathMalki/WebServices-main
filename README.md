🔍 Project Description

This React web application helps users search for nearby places (cafés, restaurants, resorts, etc.) by using a combination of two APIs:
Foursquare Places API: Used to retrieve detailed information about places (name, category, address, etc.) https://docs.foursquare.com/developer/reference/place-search
OpenCage Geocoding API: Used to convert user-entered location names into geographic coordinates (latitude & longitude) that are then passed to Foursquare. https://opencagedata.com/api


✨ Features
🔍 Search Nearby Places:
Enter a location (like a city or area name), and the app will show nearby cafés, restaurants, and resorts.

🗺️ Interactive Map:
Using React-Leaflet, the app displays a map with markers for all nearby results.

❤️ Favorites Page:
Users can save favorite places and revisit them later.

ℹ️ Place Details:
View information such as place name, category, and formatted address.

📱 Responsive Design:
Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices
